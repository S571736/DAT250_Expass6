# DAT250 Expass 6
by Sondre Lindaas Gjesdal

## Doing the work

This was an interesting expass as it combines some SpringJava, which I'm feeling fairly confident in by now, especially along with the helpful tutorial from [Spring.io](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/).

Second part of the expass was a bit more demanding of concentration due to me not having that much experience with neither JavaScript or Reactjs. Thankfully with the nice help from the tutorial and a concentrated mind I completed the tutorial faultlessly.

## Issues or technical problems

No pending issues or technical problems during this expass
